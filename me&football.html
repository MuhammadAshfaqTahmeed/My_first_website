            <h3>Thanks for taking time to explore my page furthur!</h1>
            If you are a liverpool Fan like me Lets dive into disscussing more about our wonderfull club.
            I started supporting the club from 2018, Three years after <abbr Title="Jurgen Kloop">JK</abbr> took over the management.
            So, I was fortunate enough to observe rough patches of the club. I have seen how the club grew from being a benter club to an actual title contender.
            <abbr title="Fenway Sports Group">FSG</abbr> spent very little in this period but they spent wise buy employing the right people and spending on the right personnel.
